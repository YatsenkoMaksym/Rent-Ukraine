# Unveiling Data Science Salary Trends: A Deep Dive into the Global Job Market

This project will analyze the provided Data Science Salaries dataset to uncover key trends and factors influencing compensation in the data science field, offering valuable insights for aspiring and current data professionals.

## 1. Project Objective

To identify and analyze the key factors (such as designation, experience, company size, remote work, and location) that influence Data Science salaries, and to visualize these trends to provide actionable insights.

## 2. Key Questions to Answer

- How do Data Science salaries vary across different designations (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst)?
- What is the impact of experience level on salary?
- Do company size and remote working ratio correlate with higher or lower salaries?
- Are there significant salary differences based on employee location?
- What are the overall salary trends over working years?
